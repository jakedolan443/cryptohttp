A minimalist, self-hosted web app for viewing cryptocurrency data.

CryptoHTTP is a Flask webserver which uses the `cryptowatch-sdk` module with Kraken's API to deliver a simplistic, minimalist dashboard showing current market data.

Kraken provides a free API, so no API-key is required. By default, the server sends an API request once an hour. Using an API key will increase your limit. [More info](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022839451-Generate-API-keys)

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/jakedolan443/cryptohttp
cd cryptohttp
./setup.sh
```
To run cryptohttp:
```
python3 main.py
```
cryptohttp runs on port localhost:8080. This can be changed in `main.py`

The file `coins.conf` contains a line by line list of coins, in order, displayed on the webserver, e.g.
```
BTC
ETH
XMR
```
## To do
I created this small project after becoming frustrated with the lack of available web apps for viewing simple crypto market data. I wanted something minimalist and simple that could run on relatively low resources, which I could self-host. This project is in need of contribution.
- Add support for multiple fiat currencies via an external library
- Create neater setup script
- Add sorting ability to tables
- Add support for more coins
